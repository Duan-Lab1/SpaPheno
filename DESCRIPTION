Description: Linking spatial transcriptomic patterns to clinical phenotypes is 
  essential for advancing precision oncology. We introduce SpaPheno, an interpretable 
  machine learning framework that bridges spatial transcriptomic data with clinically 
  annotated bulk RNA-seq datasets. SpaPheno integrates Elastic Net regression with 
  SHAP-based interpretation to identify spatially localized features—such as 
  cell types and tissue regions—that are predictive of patient survival, tumor stage, 
  and immunotherapy response. Through comprehensive simulations and applications to 
  spatial datasets from primary liver cancer, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), 
  breast cancer (BRCA), and melanoma, SpaPheno demonstrates superior performance and 
  broad applicability. By jointly optimizing predictive power and biological interpretability, 
  SpaPheno enables the discovery of clinically meaningful spatial biomarkers, offering a 
  generalizable approach for spatially informed precision medicine.
