Description: an R package designed to identify, visualize, and interpret spatial 
  phenotype associations from spatial transcriptomics and simulated bulk data.
  Linking spatial transcriptomic patterns to clinically relevant phenotypes 
  is a critical step toward spatially informed precision oncology. 
  Here, we introduce SpaPheno, an interpretable machine learning framework that 
  integrates spatial transcriptomics with clinically annotated bulk RNA-seq data 
  to uncover spatially resolved biomarkers predictive of patient outcomes. 
  Leveraging Elastic Net regression combined with SHAP-based attribution, 
  SpaPheno uniquely identifies spatial features at multiple scales—from tissue 
  regions to specific cell types and individual spatial spots—that are associated 
  with patient survival, tumor stage, and immunotherapy response. We demonstrate 
  the robustness and generalizability of SpaPheno through comprehensive 
  simulations and applications spanning primary liver cancer, clear cell renal 
  cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and melanoma. Across these diverse settings, 
  SpaPheno achieves high predictive accuracy while providing biologically 
  meaningful and spatially precise interpretations. Our framework offers 
  a powerful and extensible approach for translating complex spatial omics data 
  into actionable clinical insights, accelerating the development of precision 
  oncology strategies grounded in tumor spatial architecture.
