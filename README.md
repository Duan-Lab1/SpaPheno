# SpaPheno: Linking Spatial Transcriptomics to Clinical Phenotypes with Interpretable Machine Learning

## Overview

**SpaPheno** is an R package designed to identify, visualize, and
interpret spatial phenotype associations from spatial transcriptomics
and simulated bulk data. Linking spatial transcriptomic patterns to
clinical phenotypes is essential for advancing precision oncology. We
introduce SpaPheno, an interpretable machine learning framework that
bridges spatial transcriptomic data with clinically annotated bulk
RNA-seq datasets. SpaPheno integrates Elastic Net regression with
SHAP-based interpretation to identify spatially localized featuresâ€”such
as cell types and tissue regionsâ€”that are predictive of patient
survival, tumor stage, and immunotherapy response. Through comprehensive
simulations and applications to spatial datasets from primary liver
cancer, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), breast cancer (BRCA),
and melanoma, SpaPheno demonstrates superior performance and broad
applicability. By jointly optimizing predictive power and biological
interpretability, SpaPheno enables the discovery of clinically
meaningful spatial biomarkers, offering a generalizable approach for
spatially informed precision medicine.

## :sunny: Key Features

- **Construct predictive models** from cell type compositions and
  phenotypic labels (e.g., disease presence).
- **Map spatial risk distributions** across tissues or organs using
  spatially-aware neighborhood features.
- **Assess statistical significance** through permutation-based tests.
- **Interpret feature contributions** using SHAP (SHapley Additive
  exPlanations) analysis at single-cell resolution.
