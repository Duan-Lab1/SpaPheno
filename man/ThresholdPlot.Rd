\title{Plot Prediction vs. Permutation Distributions with Significance Thresholds}
\usage{
ThresholdPlot(prediction, permutation, p = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{prediction}{A numeric vector of predicted scores.}

\item{permutation}{A numeric vector representing the null distribution (e.g., scores from permutations).}

\item{p}{Numeric, the significance level for defining extreme regions (two-tailed). Default is 0.01.}
}
\value{
No return value. This function generates a base R plot showing the density curves
of the prediction and permutation distributions, with shaded areas representing values
beyond the significance thresholds.
}
\description{
Visualizes the density distribution of prediction scores in comparison to a null distribution
(e.g., from permutation), and highlights statistically significant regions based on a two-tailed
threshold. This is useful for visually identifying predictions that deviate meaningfully
from chance expectation.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
pred <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0.5)
perm <- rnorm(1000)
ThresholdPlot(prediction = pred, permutation = perm, p = 0.01)
