\title{SHAP Dependence Plot for Selected Features}
\usage{
SpaPheno_SHAP_dependence_plot(shap_df, feature_names, title = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{shap_df}{A data.frame with SHAP output. Must contain columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature}: Name of the feature.
  \item \code{feature.value}: The actual value of the feature in a sample.
  \item \code{phi}: The SHAP value associated with that feature/sample.
}}

\item{feature_names}{Character vector of feature names to include in the plot.}

\item{title}{Optional character string for the plot title. Default is \code{"SHAP Dependence Plot"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing SHAP dependence plots for selected features.
}
\description{
Visualizes the relationship between SHAP values and corresponding feature values
across samples, stratified by selected features.
}
\details{
This function generates a scatter plot of SHAP values versus feature values,
overlaid with a LOESS smoothed curve. Each feature specified in \code{feature_names}
is plotted in a separate facet panel. Useful for interpreting the directionality
and interaction effects of SHAP-based model explanations.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
shap_df <- data.frame(
  feature = rep(c("GeneA", "GeneB"), each = 50),
  feature.value = rnorm(100),
  phi = rnorm(100)
)
SpaPheno_SHAP_dependence_plot(shap_df, c("GeneA", "GeneB"), title = "Example SHAP Plot")
}
