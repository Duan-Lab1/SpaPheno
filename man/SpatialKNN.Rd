\title{Compute K-Nearest Neighbors for Spatial Coordinates}
\usage{
SpatialKNN(sample_information_coordinate, k = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_information_coordinate}{A data.frame or matrix. Rows are spatial units (e.g., cells or spots), columns are coordinates (e.g., x and y).}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of nearest neighbors to compute (default = 50).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{knn_value}{A matrix of distances to the k nearest neighbors (first column is self, with distance 0).}
\item{knn_sample}{A matrix of neighbor names (cell/spot IDs), with self in the first column.}
}
\description{
Given a matrix of spatial coordinates, this function computes the k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
for each point using Euclidean distance. It returns the neighbor indices and distances.
}
\details{
- The input coordinate matrix must have rownames corresponding to spot or cell IDs.
- The output includes a neighbor matrix with the first column as the self point.
- Distances to self are set to 0 by definition.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
coords <- data.frame(x = runif(10), y = runif(10))
rownames(coords) <- paste0("cell", 1:10)
result <- SpatialKNN(coords, k = 3)
result$knn_sample
result$knn_value
}
