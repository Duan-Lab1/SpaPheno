}
\arguments{
\item{bulk_decon}{A matrix or data.frame with bulk samples (rows) and cell type proportions (columns), typically from deconvolution.}

\item{bulk_pheno}{A named vector of bulk phenotypes. Can be binary labels (e.g., 0/1), survival time, or continuous traits. Names must match \code{rownames(bulk_decon)}.}

\item{family}{Modeling family. One of \code{"cox"} (survival), \code{"binomial"} (classification), or \code{"gaussian"} (regression).}

\item{coord}{A named list of spatial coordinate matrices for each spatial sample (data.frame with x, y).}

\item{resolution}{Spatial resolution. One of \code{"spot"} (e.g., 10x Visium) or \code{"single_cell"} (e.g., MERFISH, CosMx).}

\item{sample_information_decon}{A list of spot-level cell type proportions (only used if \code{resolution = "spot"}). Each entry is a data.frame with rows as spots and columns as cell types.}

\item{sample_information_cellType}{A list of single-cell annotations (only used if \code{resolution = "single_cell"}). Each entry is a character vector of cell types.}

\item{k}{Number of spatial neighbors to consider for KNN-based feature construction. Default is 50.}

\item{r}{Number of spatial shells/layers for context expansion. Default is 2.}

\item{p}{SHAP value threshold for phenotype labeling and significance testing. Default is 0.}

\item{size}{Point size used in visualization plots. Default is 1.}

\item{n_perm}{Number of permutations for significance estimation. Default is 10.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 2025.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of cross-validation folds for elastic net modeling. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pred_score}{A data.frame of prediction scores and assigned phenotype labels.}
\item{cell_type_distribution}{Feature matrix used for prediction.}
\item{model}{Trained elastic net model object.}
}
\description{
Perform interpretable phenotype projection from bulk transcriptomic phenotypes
to spatial transcriptomics data using elastic net modeling and SHAP-based spatial mapping.
