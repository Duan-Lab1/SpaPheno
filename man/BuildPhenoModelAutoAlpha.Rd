\usage{
BuildPhenoModelAutoAlpha(
  expr,
  pheno,
  family = c("cox", "binomial", "gaussian"),
  nfolds = 10,
  seed = 2025
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of gene expression or cell-type proportion data (samples Ã— features).}

\item{pheno}{A response vector of phenotypes: survival object, binary labels, or continuous outcomes.}

\item{family}{Character string indicating the type of outcome. Must be one of \code{"cox"}, \code{"binomial"}, or \code{"gaussian"}.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of folds to use in cross-validation. Default is 10.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 2025.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{model}}{The fitted \code{cv.glmnet} object with best alpha.}
  \item{\code{lambda}}{The lambda.min value corresponding to the best alpha.}
  \item{\code{alpha}}{The optimal alpha value selected.}
}
}
\description{
This function builds an Elastic Net model using \code{glmnet}, with automatic
alpha selection via cross-validation. It supports generalized linear models
for survival analysis (Cox), binary classification, and regression tasks.
}
\details{
The function performs K-fold cross-validation across a range of alpha values
to identify the optimal alpha that minimizes the cross-validation error.
Once the best alpha is selected, the model is re-trained using that alpha.

Applicable families:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"cox"}: Cox proportional hazards model (survival)
  \item \code{"binomial"}: Logistic regression (binary classification)
  \item \code{"gaussian"}: Linear regression (continuous outcomes)
}
}

data("osmFISH_bulk_pheno")

# Survival example

model <- BuildPhenoModelAutoAlpha(
  expr = matrix(rnorm(30), nrow = 3),
  pheno = surv_obj,
  family = "cox")
